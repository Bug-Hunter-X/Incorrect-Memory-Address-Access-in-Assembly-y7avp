# Incorrect Memory Address Access in Assembly
This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: using an incorrect memory address. The `bug.asm` file contains code that attempts to access memory at address 1000h without properly allocating or verifying the address's validity. This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or data corruption. The `bugSolution.asm` file shows how to correct this issue by using appropriate memory allocation and addressing techniques.  Understanding memory management is critical in assembly programming.  This example highlights the importance of careful address calculations and the potential consequences of errors in memory access.
